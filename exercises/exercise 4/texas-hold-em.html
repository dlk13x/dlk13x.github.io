      <p>
        Texas Hold'em is the most widely played variant of poker and serves as
        an excellent starting point for new players. In this game, players
        receive two private cards (hole cards), and five community cards are
        placed face-up on the table. The objective is to form the best hand
        using any combination of these seven cards.
